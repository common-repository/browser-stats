== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't the the bars match the actual number percentage? =

Internet Explorer 6 seems to have a negative reaction to the CSS that creates the bars,  The number percentage is accurate though.

= Why does the widget stick out past the sidebar? =

The information is displayed in a table that has a defined height and width which might not fit within your sidebar,  look for an auto-scaling widget in later versions.
